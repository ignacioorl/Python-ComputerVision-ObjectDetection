# Python-ComputerVision-ObjectDetection

The objective of this notebook is to create an object detection model, based on YOLOv8. The three categories to detect are:

1. Hat (category = 0)
2. Vests (category = 1)
3. Workers (category = 2)

Please note that this notebook was run using Google Colab. In addition, the datasets can be found on this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ciber-lab/pictor-ppe#dataset.
